Activity detection:\n   - Monitor recent Instagram activities including:\n     - New comments on posts or reels\n     - Mentions or tags\n     - Incoming direct messages\n   - If {TargetActivities} is specific, focus only on those activities.\n   - If {TargetActivities} is \"any\", process all relevant activities.\n\n2. Comment handling:\n   - For new comments on posts or reels:\n     - Analyze comment intent:\n       - Compliment or positive feedback\n       - Question or clarification\n       - Emoji or casual reaction\n       - Negative or spam content\n     - If comment is positive or appreciative:\n       - Like the comment.\n     - If comment asks a question:\n       - Like the comment and generate a short, relevant reply.\n     - If comment is spam or inappropriate:\n       - Ignore or skip interaction.\n\n3. Direct message handling:\n   - If {TargetDMs} is \"unread\":\n     - Open unread chats only.\n   - Read recent messages in each conversation.\n   - If a reel, image, or video is received:\n     - Analyze visible content, captions, and context.\n     - Infer intent such as reaction request, casual sharing, or inquiry.\n\n4. Reply generation:\n   - Generate replies that directly reference the content or message.\n   - Adjust reply style based on {ReplyTone}:\n     - professional\n     - casual\n     - friendly\n     - neutral\n   - Keep replies natural, concise, and platform-appropriate.\n\n5. Reply mode handling:\n   - If {ReplyMode} is \"auto\":\n     - Send replies automatically.\n   - If {ReplyMode} is \"suggest\":\n     - Prepare reply drafts without sending.\n\n6. Safety and relevance checks:\n   - Avoid replying to sensitive, ambiguous, or risky messages.\n   - Do not engage with spam, scams, or aggressive content.\n   - Skip activities where context is unclear.\n\nFinal Action:\nComplete all eligible Instagram interactions (likes, replies, messages) and stop after processing current activity."
