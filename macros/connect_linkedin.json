Alumni sourcing via Telegram bot:\n   - Open Telegram and navigate to {SourceBot}.\n   - Request a list of {AlumniCount} alumni profiles for {TargetInstitute}.\n   - Ensure returned data includes:\n     - Full Name\n     - Institute reference (IIT Patna)\n     - Optional role/company or LinkedIn hint\n   - Save the received alumni list into current context files for session use.\n\n2. Data validation and preparation:\n   - Deduplicate names if any repeats exist.\n   - Prioritize profiles that clearly reference {TargetInstitute}.\n   - Maintain original ordering to avoid aggressive targeting patterns.\n\n3. LinkedIn search strategy:\n   - Open LinkedIn using {LinkedInAccount}.\n   - For each saved alumni name:\n     - Search using full name + \"{TargetInstitute}\" keyword.\n     - Prefer direct profile matches over broad people lists.\n     - If multiple results appear:\n       - Select the profile that mentions IIT Patna in education.\n\n4. Connection decision logic:\n   - Skip profiles that already show \"Connected\" or \"Follow\".\n   - Avoid profiles with restricted connection settings.\n   - If {DailyLimit} is \"safe\":\n     - Space actions with natural delays.\n     - Avoid consecutive rapid searches or connects.\n\n5. Connection request behavior:\n   - Click \"Connect\" on the resolved profile.\n   - If a note option appears:\n     - If {ConnectNote} is \"auto\":\n       - Generate a short, neutral alumni-based note.\n     - If no note is required:\n       - Send without note.\n   - Mimic human behavior by:\n     - Occasional scrolling\n     - Profile dwell time before action\n\n6. Anti-ban safety rules:\n   - Do not exceed safe hourly or daily thresholds.\n   - Avoid repeating identical notes across multiple requests.\n   - Pause execution if LinkedIn shows warning signals or friction.\n\nFinal Action:\nSend connection requests to all valid alumni profiles sourced from  g1x"
