Telegram interaction:\n   - Open Telegram.\n   - Search for {TelegramBot}.\n   - Initiate conversation if not already active.\n   - Request permission to analyze emails for schedule related work like timetable {EmailScope}.\n\n2. Email analysis:\n   - Read emails from today and yesterday.\n   - Identify:\n     - Class timings\n     - Meetings or events\n     - Deadlines or reminders\n   - Extract structured data:\n     - Event title\n     - Date\n     - Start and end time\n     - Location or meeting mode (online/offline)\n     - Priority or importance\n\n3. Schedule structuring:\n   - Normalize all extracted events into {ScheduleFormat}.\n   - Ensure compatibility with {TargetCalendar} requirements:\n     - Explicit date\n     - Time blocks\n     - Clear titles\n     - Optional notes or tags\n   - Resolve conflicts by:\n     - Prioritizing fixed classes over flexible events\n     - Flagging overlaps if needed\n\n4. Backend context update:\n   - Write the structured schedule into the current context file of the backend.\n   - Maintain a clean, ordered list for today and upcoming days.\n   - Ensure idempotency (avoid duplicate entries).\n\n5. Notion calender scheduling:\n   - Open {NotionWorkspace} in the Android app.\n   - Navigate to the daily or weekly schedule view.\n   - Create or update entries using the prepared schedule:\n     - Title\n     - Time range\n     - Notes or links\n   - Verify that all events are correctly placed.\n\n6. Workflow refinement:\n   - Review the final schedule for gaps or overload.\n   - Suggest minor optimizations:\n     - Breaks between classes\n     - Buffer time for transitions\n     - Grouping similar activities\n\nFinal Action:\nComplete schedule generation, update backend context, sync all events to Notion calender , and stop after confirmation."
