Scope Definition:\n   - Check {Apps}. \n   - If {Apps} contains specific names (e.g., \"Instagram, X\"): Create a \"Target List\" of only those apps.\n   - If {Apps} says \"All Installed...\": Create a \"Target List\" by scanning for ANY app categorized as Social/Chat.\n\n3. Execution Loop (Repeat for items in Target List):\n   - Open the current app from the Target List.\n   - Tap the \"Create\" / \"Upload\" / \"+\" button.\n   - When the media picker opens, navigate to Gallery -> Albums.\n   - Scroll down and find > {SourceFolder}.\n   - Open and select the most recent image (as initially told).\n   - Paste {Caption} from clipboard into the text field.\n   - Tap \"Post\".\n   - Wait for \"Posting/Sent\" notification.\n   - Close app and proceed to the next item in Target List.\n\n4.
